CryptAByte
==========

CryptAByte.com is a free online drop box that enables secure (encrypted) message and file sharing over the web using a public-key infrastructure.

Messages and files are encrypted using a public key and can only be decrypted using the passphrase entered when your key is created. Your data is never stored in plaintext, and is impossible to decrypt without your passphrase.

==========

Crypt-A-Byte uses public-key encryption just like HTTPS/SSL and OpenPGP/PGP. We encourage you to use these tools whenever possible.

However, PGP requires that you and your recipient install and configure encryption software and create and exchange key pairs. When this is not practical, we make it very simple (and free) to share data using the same algorithms over the web.

We use RSA for key pairs, encrypt messages and files using AES 256, and SHA256 for hashing.

CryptoPad is a simple AES256 encryption/decryption app.
